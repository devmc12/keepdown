## Markdown View Modes

A three-button toggle is added next to Keep's "Pin note" button inside the modal:

- **Editor** — Default Google Keep editing view, no Markdown preview
- **Editor and Preview** — Side-by-side editor and rendered Markdown preview, with optional preview scrolling that follows the editor
- **Preview** — Rendered Markdown only, editor hidden

The active mode is saved per-note, so each note remembers its own view preference.

## Extension Settings

Click the extension icon to open the settings popup:

- **Markdown by default** — Toggle whether new notes open in Split mode or Editor mode
- **Sync editor scroll** — Toggle whether the preview follows editor scrolling in Split mode; enabled by default
- **Preview theme** — Follow Google Keep's current appearance by default, falling back to the system appearance, or choose a fixed Dark or Light theme with a live preview sample
- **Preserve soft line breaks** — Keep single line breaks visible inside normal paragraphs; disabled by default to preserve standard CommonMark rendering
- **Editor width** — Slider (50%–95%) to control modal width in Editor-only mode
- **Preview modes width** — Slider (50%–95%) to control modal width in Split / Preview modes
- **Reset** — Restore all settings to defaults

All changes sync instantly to any open Keep tab without reloading.

## Chrome Extension Permissions

This extension uses minimal permissions:

### Content Script Host Access

  1. Add the Markdown preview panel to the note editor
  2. Listen for changes in the note content to update the preview
  3. Apply custom styling for the preview panel
  
  The extension does not:
  - Collect or transmit any note content
  - Access any Google account information
  - Modify or store your notes
  - Make any network requests
  
  All processing is done locally in your browser.

### storage Permission
- Used to save your preferences (such as note modal widths, preview theme, scroll sync, and paragraph line break behavior) between browser sessions. This ensures your customized settings persist after closing and reopening your browser.
